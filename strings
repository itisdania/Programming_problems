printing off a string,

include <stdio.h>
main (void) 
{
int string;
printf("enter a string: ");
scanf("%c",&string);

// As computers usually have /0 at the end of any string, we are telling the computer that when it reaches the end of the string or (/0) end the program.

for(int i =0; string[i] != '/0'; i++)    ALSO we can use for(int i =0; string[i] != strlen(string); i++)  

// strlen(string) is to figure out the length of the string, we need to include string.h , try to assign strlen to a variable so you dont have to ask for its value again and again
 {
//here we will not add \n as we need all the letters to be next to each other to actually form a word
printf("%c",string );
 }
}
